# ELM
### Goal
The goal of this project was to create a small word guessing game using elm. The main purpose of the project was to use the elm functionnal language. The requirement included the use of a dictionnary api to retrieve and display the definitions of words.

### How to use
The code was tested to work in elm reactor. After downloading the code, open a command prompt and go in the folder of the project. Use the command ```elm reactor``` and open the address in a web browser. From there, navigate to src and click ```Http_request.elm```.

From there, you can play the game by entering the word corresponding to the definitions displayed. If you are correct, a green text will inform you. At any time you can show the answer by clicking the checkbox or change word by clicking the button.
